# Table Top DnD
Side project for my DnD group. This will be meant to be like a clone of astral table top.
Since astral is no longer being actively worked on, I wanted to make an open-source version for my friends.

Basic setup:
* Vue 3
* Phaser
* MongoDB
* NodeJS

npm install
```

```

### Compiles and minifies for production

npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files

npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
